# ur5_coppeliasim_roscontrol
 A demo shows a full integration of `ros_control` controllers and CoppeliaSim simulator. This package contains the required configuration, scene, and `.launch` files to bring up and control a UR5 robot in CoppeliaSim. This demo is a direct application of both the [RosControl][] and the [RosServices][] plugins provided by `coppeliasim_ros_control` and `coppeliasim_ros_services`.
 
## Dependencies
- [coppeliasim_ros_control][]: a plugin to enable use of `ros_control` in the CoppeliaSim simulator
- [coppeliasim_ros_services][]: this plugin supports a collection of ROS services to enable remote control of the CoppeliaSim simulator
- [coppeliasim_msgs_srvs][]: contains the required `.msg`s and `.srv`s that enable ROS to communicate with and control the CoppeliaSim simulator
- [coppeliasim_run][]: to run CoppeliaSim as a ROS node using a `system(..)` call
- [ur_description][]: contains the description of the UR5 robot   
- [ur_gazebo][]: contains the `arm_controller` which will be used to control the UR5 robot
- [ur5_moveit_config][]: contains all `.launch` files required for MoveIt to control a UR5


### Building 
The following instructions assume that a Catkin workspace has been created at `$HOME/catkin_ws` and the CoppeliaSim directory is located at `$HOME/CoppeliaSim`. You can always update the paths based on your machine setup.

```bash
# change to the src directory in your Catkin workspace
 cd $HOME/catkin_ws/src

# Clone coppeliasim_ros_control pkg 
 git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/ur5_coppeliasim_roscontrol

# Clone all dependencies in same workspace
 git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/coppeliasim_ros_control
 git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/coppeliasim_ros_services
 git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/coppeliasim_msgs_srvs
 git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-a-ali/coppeliasim_run
 git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot

# change to the root of the Catkin workspace
 cd ..

# build the workspace (using catkin_tools)
 catkin build

# source the workspace
source devel/setup.bash 
```

### Running
Copy both the `libsimExtRosControl.so` and the `libsimExtRosServices.so` plugins generated by [coppeliasim_ros_control][], and [coppeliasim_ros_services][] to the CoppeliaSim directory :
```
# Copy the generated plugins to CoppeliaSim directory
cp  $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libsimExtRosControl.so  $HOME/CoppeliaSim/
cp  $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/lib/libsimExtRosServices.so  $HOME/CoppeliaSim/
```
Launch the demo using the `ur5_demo.launch` launch file:
```
 roslaunch ur5_coppeliasim_roscontrol ur5_demo.launch 
```
the `ur5_demo.launch` launch file will:
- start CoppeliaSim itself, with a scene which includes the UR5
- start the simulation
- load UR5 description onto the ROS parameter server by launching the `ur5_upload.launch` file from the `ur_description` pkg
- load the `arm_controller_ur5.yaml` file from the `ur_gazebo` pkg, the `arm_controller` is a `position_controllers/JointTrajectoryController` `ros_control` controller
- launch the `controller_utils.launch` file from the `ur_gazebo` pkg 
- spawn the `arm_controller` using the `controller_manager` pkg 
- launch the `ur5_moveit_planning_execution.launch` file from the `ur5_moveit_config` pkg
- launch the `moveit_rviz.launch`file from the `ur5_moveit_config` pkg

By launching the `ur5_demo.launch` launch file, you will see two windows: CoppeliaSim (with a running simulation of a UR5) and RViz (with a motion planning interface configured for the UR5), then you can use the motion planning interface in RViz to control the UR5 in CoppeliaSim. You can use also the available topics and services to control the simulation inside CoppeliaSim.


### Generate your own configuration package
This package contains configuration/launch/scene files to control a UR5 in CoppeliaSim. If you want to create your own configuration package to control your own robot in CoppeliaSim, follow these steps:
- Create a scene file in CoppeliaSim for your own robot (e.g. `scene.ttt`). If the model of the robot you are using is available in CoppeliaSim, then you just need to create a new scene and drag the model of your robot into the scene. If it is not available, you can use the [urdf_plugin][] to convert your urdf model to a CoppeliaSim scene.
- Create a `controller.yaml` file to specify which controller you want to use to control your own robot.
- Create a `.launch` file to:
    - start CoppeliaSim, pass your robot_scene `scene.ttt` as an argument to the `coppeliasim` node
    - load your `robot_description` from your `.xacro` or `.urdf` file to the param server
    - load your `controller.yaml` to param server
    - spawn your controller using the `controller_manager` pkg
